# [svelteKitStripped](https://sveltekitstripped.netlify.app)
A stripped down version of the SvelteKit demo app for learning Svelte!

Helps me learn Svelte and understand how to pull in componenets/libraries. I found myself regularly stripping down the SvelteKit demo app while learning, so why not public-repo it instead?
```
nvm i 18

npm i

npm run dev
