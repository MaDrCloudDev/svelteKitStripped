# [svelteKitStripped](https://sveltekitstripped.netlify.app)
A stripped down version of the SvelteKit demo app.

Helps me learn Svelte and understand how to pull in componenets/libraries. I found myself regularly stripping down the SvelteKit demo app while learning, so why not public-repo it instead? I like that the demo is a prebuilt single-page app, with routing, that installs well as an application with Microsoft Edge Chromium.

```nvm i 18

npm i

npm run dev
